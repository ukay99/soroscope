**SoroScope** is a developer tool designed to provide deep visibility into Soroban smart contract resource consumption (CPU, RAM, and Ledger Footprint).

## 🚀 The Vision
Building on Soroban requires careful resource management. SoroScope provides a "Nutrition Label" for your smart contracts, helping you optimize for lower fees and higher performance before you deploy to Mainnet.

## 🧱 Monorepo Structure
- `/core`: Rust-based CLI for simulating and profiling contracts.
- `/web`: Next.js + Tailwind CSS dashboard for visualizing resource heatmaps.
- `/contracts`: Sample Soroban contracts used for benchmarking.
- `/.github/workflows`: CI/CD pipelines.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Rust** (stable, via [rustup](https://rustup.rs))
- **Node.js** (>= 18) and **npm** / **pnpm** / **yarn**
- Soroban CLI & tooling (recommended) for real-network interaction

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoroLabs/soroscope
cd soroscope
```

---

## 🧰 Core CLI (`/core`)

The **core** crate is a Rust binary that will power SoroScope's resource profiling.

### Features
- **Resource Profiling**: Analyze CPU, RAM, and ledger footprint consumption
- **Gas Golfing Analysis**: Automated detection of gas-heavy patterns with optimization suggestions
- **Contract Simulation**: Test contract functions with various inputs
- **Fee Market Analysis**: Real-time fee predictions and market conditions

### Build & Run
```bash
# Build the binary
cargo build -p soroscope-core

# Run the server (RUST_LOG=info is required to see API logs)
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p soroscope-core
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### Merkle Tree Utility

The core crate includes an off-chain Merkle Tree utility (`core/src/merkle_tree.rs`) for building binary Merkle trees and generating inclusion proofs compatible with the `cross_chain_verifier` contract.

**Build a tree and get the root:**

```bash
# Run your script that calls MerkleTree::build() and prints the root hex
ROOT=$(cargo run --example build_tree -- --block 1000)

# Post the root on-chain
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source relayer \
  --network testnet \
  -- update_root \
  --block_height 1000 \
  --new_root "$ROOT"
```

**Verify a proof on-chain:**

```bash
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  -- verify_message \
  --block_height 1000 \
  --leaf "<leaf_hex>" \
  --proof '["<sibling_hex>"]' \
  --proof_flags '[true]'
```

**Run Merkle Tree tests:**

```bash
cargo test -p soroscope-core merkle_tree
```

See [`core/MERKLE_TREE_README.md`](./core/MERKLE_TREE_README.md) for full API reference, proof generation examples, and the complete relayer pipeline.

## 🌐 Web Dashboard (`/web`)

The **web** app is a Next.js + Tailwind CSS dashboard for exploring resource usage visually.

### Features
- **Client-Side Simulation Rate Limiting**: Throttles contract simulation requests to a maximum of 2 calls per second via `RequestQueueManager` to prevent hitting Soroban RPC rate limits (429/503).
- **Infinite Scroll Telemetry Logs**: Smooth `IntersectionObserver`-based infinite scrolling for browsing historical telemetry logs and transaction records.

### Install Dependencies
```bash
cd web
npm install        # or: pnpm install / yarn install
```

### Run in Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open:
- http://localhost:3000

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## 📦 Contracts (`/contracts`)

This folder contains sample Soroban contracts. To build them for analysis:

```bash
# Build all contracts to WASM
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

The resulting `.wasm` files will be located in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`. You can upload these to the Web Dashboard for profiling.

## 📅 Roadmap (2026)
- **Phase 1 [COMPLETED]:** Core CLI engine for resource extraction.
- **Phase 2 [IN PROGRESS]:** Integration of Frontend dashboard with Backend simulation engine.
- **Phase 3 [IN PROGRESS]:** Automated optimization recommendations (Gas Golfing Analysis ✓).

---

## 🧪 Development & Scripts

From the **repo root**:

- Check workspace builds:
  ```bash
  cargo build
  ```

- Format Rust code:
  ```bash
  cargo fmt
  ```

- Lint / type-check web app:
  ```bash
  cd web
  npm run lint
  ```

These checks run automatically on every push and pull request via the CI pipeline in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`cargo check`, `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, and frontend lint).
